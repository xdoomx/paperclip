# Plugin Authoring Guide

This guide describes the current, implemented way to create a Paperclip plugin in this repo.

It is intentionally narrower than [PLUGIN_SPEC.md](./PLUGIN_SPEC.md). The spec includes future ideas; this guide only covers the alpha surface that exists now.

## Current reality

- Treat plugin workers and plugin UI as trusted code.
- Plugin UI runs as same-origin JavaScript inside the main Paperclip app.
- Worker-side host APIs are capability-gated.
- Plugin UI is not sandboxed by manifest capabilities.
- There is no host-provided shared React component kit for plugins yet.
- `ctx.assets` is not supported in the current runtime.

## Scaffold a plugin

Use the scaffold package:

```bash
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/create-paperclip-plugin build
node packages/plugins/create-paperclip-plugin/dist/index.js @yourscope/plugin-name --output ./packages/plugins/examples
```

For a plugin that lives outside the Paperclip repo:

```bash
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/create-paperclip-plugin build
node packages/plugins/create-paperclip-plugin/dist/index.js @yourscope/plugin-name \
  --output /absolute/path/to/plugin-repos \
  --sdk-path /absolute/path/to/paperclip/packages/plugins/sdk
```

That creates a package with:

- `src/manifest.ts`
- `src/worker.ts`
- `src/ui/index.tsx`
- `tests/plugin.spec.ts`
- `esbuild.config.mjs`
- `rollup.config.mjs`

Inside this monorepo, the scaffold uses `workspace:*` for `@paperclipai/plugin-sdk`.

Outside this monorepo, the scaffold snapshots `@paperclipai/plugin-sdk` from the local Paperclip checkout into a `.paperclip-sdk/` tarball so you can build and test a plugin without publishing anything to npm first.

## Recommended local workflow

From the generated plugin folder:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

For local development, install it into Paperclip from an absolute local path through the plugin manager or API. The server supports local filesystem installs and watches local-path plugins for file changes so worker restarts happen automatically after rebuilds.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3100/api/plugins/install \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"packageName":"/absolute/path/to/your-plugin","isLocalPath":true}'
```

## Supported alpha surface

Worker:

- config
- events
- jobs
- launchers
- http
- secrets
- activity
- state
- entities
- projects and project workspaces
- companies
- issues and comments
- agents and agent sessions
- goals
- data/actions
- streams
- tools
- metrics
- logger

UI:

- `usePluginData`
- `usePluginAction`
- `usePluginStream`
- `usePluginToast`
- `useHostContext`
- typed slot props from `@paperclipai/plugin-sdk/ui`

Mount surfaces currently wired in the host include:

- `page`
- `settingsPage`
- `dashboardWidget`
- `sidebar`
- `sidebarPanel`
- `detailTab`
- `taskDetailView`
- `projectSidebarItem`
- `globalToolbarButton`
- `toolbarButton`
- `contextMenuItem`
- `commentAnnotation`
- `commentContextMenuItem`

## Company routes

Plugins may declare a `page` slot with `routePath` to own a company route like:

```text
/:companyPrefix/<routePath>
```

Rules:

- `routePath` must be a single lowercase slug
- it cannot collide with reserved host routes
- it cannot duplicate another installed plugin page route

## Publishing guidance

- Use npm packages as the deployment artifact.
- Treat repo-local example installs as a development workflow only.
- Prefer keeping plugin UI self-contained inside the package.
- Do not rely on host design-system components or undocumented app internals.
- GitHub repository installs are not a first-class workflow today. For local development, use a checked-out local path. For production, publish to npm or a private npm-compatible registry.

## Verification before handoff

At minimum:

```bash
pnpm --filter <your-plugin-package> typecheck
pnpm --filter <your-plugin-package> test
pnpm --filter <your-plugin-package> build
```

If you changed host integration too, also run:

```bash
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm test:run
pnpm build
```
